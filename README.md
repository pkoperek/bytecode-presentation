  * JVM spec quotes:
    * "The Java Virtual Machine knows nothing of the Java programming language, only of a particular binary format, the class file format. A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (or byteco    des) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information".
    * "The Java Virtual Machine is stack-oriented, with most operations taking one or more operands from the operand stack of the Java Virtual Machine's current frame or pushing results back onto the opera    nd stack."
    * "Each frame contains an array of variables known as its local variables. The length of the local variable array of a frame is determined at compile-time and supplied in the binary representation of a     class or interface along with the code for the method associated with the frame." (JVM Spec 2.6.1. Local Variables)
